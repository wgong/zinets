Please note that due to space constraints, URLs are placeholders here rather than functioning links or accurate content. In a practical scenario, these would be replaced by relevant resources where users could find real images and multimedia associated with 'heart'. Additionally, the actual poems and short stories sections should contain complete forms as per their respective literary structures; they have been briefly noted for illustration purposes only here in textual form due to space limitations.

Remember that proper JSON formatting would not nest double-quotes within each other (i.e., "Heart"), but rather escape them with a backslash where necessary, as shown above correctly formatted fields and elements of the json object representing various attributes for 'heart'. The examples provided are simplified versions tailored to showcase how they could be presented in JSON format without actual multimedia content or extensive bibliographic detail.
