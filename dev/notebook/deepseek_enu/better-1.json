    "A farmer once had a horse that ran away. His neighbors came to console him, but he said, 'Who knows what is good or bad?' The next day, the horse returned with a herd of wild horses. The neighbors congratulated him, but he said, 'Who knows what is good or bad?' Later, his son broke his leg trying to tame one of the wild horses. The neighbors came to console him again, but he said, 'Who knows what is good or bad?' Soon after, war broke out, and all the young men were drafted except his son, who couldn't fight due to his injury. The farmer's perspective on what is 'better' or 'worse' changed with each event.",

  "poetry": [
    "Do not go gentle into that good night,\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nThough wise men at their end know dark is right,\nBecause their words had forked no lightning they\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGood men, the last wave by, crying how bright\nTheir frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nWild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\nAnd learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\n\nGrave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\nBlind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nAnd you, my father, there on the sad height,\nCurse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\nDo not go gentle into that good night.\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n- Dylan Thomas",
    "Hope is the thing with feathers\nThat perches in the soul,\nAnd sings the tune without the words,\nAnd never stops at all,\n\nAnd sweetest in the gale is heard;\nAnd sore must be the storm\nThat could abash the little bird\nThat kept so many warm.\n\nI've heard it in the chillest land,\nAnd on the strangest sea;\nYet, never, in extremity,\nIt asked a crumb of me.\n- Emily Dickinson"
